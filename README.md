## Project Description

This is an application which allows the user to add burgers to a menu. This adds the burger to a list and creates a button which allows the user to "devour" the burger. When devoured, the burger is then put on the other list of "devoured" burgers. The project uses mysql, handlebars, node, and express.

## Installation

Type "npm i" in the terminal to download the necessary node modules. Copy the schema and seed files to your sql manager and create the database. Make sure to update the connection object with your own information before running node. Use "node server.js" in the terminal to start the application.
